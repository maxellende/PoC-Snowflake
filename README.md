# PoC Snowflake
Internship subject - Study of the lakehouse pattern and PoC of the cloud data platform Snowflake

This project aims to evaluate the cloud data platform Snowflake as a tool for AI worloads. Snowflake is an implementation of the lakehouse pattern, merging two reknowned patterns : warehouse and data lake. The lakehouse pattern combines the best of them : 

- Elastic storage at low cost thanks to data lake + governance, security and data management thanks to warehouse
- Storage for structured, semi-structured and unstructured data supported by data lake
- Raw and consildated data for complete information as well as ready-to-use data in model training
- Wide range of application : BI, ML, AI

Implementation of this pattern can looks like a cloud data storage with multiple virtual warehouse on top of it, as Snowflake is.


Here is the architecture of my project :
